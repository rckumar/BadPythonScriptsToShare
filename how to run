How I did it:

Clicked the link https://github.com/ShoddyPythonScriptMan/BadPythonScriptsToShare

Clicked "Clone or Download"

Download and install Python

Download and install Anaconda

Download and install PyCharm Community edition (it had a checkbox to install Jre along with it during the installation wizard, which I accepted)

Run the console through PyCharm (alt+F12)

Type pip install bs4

Once it's done type pip install requests

Get the console to the folder you downloaded his github stuff to (usually by typing something like cd c:\users...)

Type Python BookShelfScrape (I renamed it because the prompt was having an issue with the spaces)

I hope I didn't forget any of the steps and I know this is obvious for a lot of people, but for me it involved a lot o googling and failed attempts, so I figured I might as well share. =)
